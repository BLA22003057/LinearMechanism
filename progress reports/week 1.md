# Week 1 Progress Report

For the first week, we planned to focus on concept of development, and CAD design.

We first made a rough model of the design to get a vague idea of how the final design should look and function.
After realising the design could be remade lighter and more structurally stable, we redesigned everything using the information we gathered from the initial design.
