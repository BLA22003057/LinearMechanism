# Final Evaluation and Test

For the final test and evaluation of the mechanism, we applied increasing loads until the mechanism couldn't handle any more force.

First, we applied the target load of 30g. Which the mechanism handled perfectly, with no stress on the gears other than a slight added extra resistance.

Second, we applied a weight of 150g. Which again, the mechanism handles fine. The additional load increased the resistance between the gears, but it wasn't enough to affect the performance of the mechanism significantly.

Third, a weight of 300g was applied. The mechanism could handle this, but we decided this was rough limit of the mechanism's ability.

Finally, we applied a weight of 500g, which the mechanism could not handle. It seemed as if the handle would break, and there was not enough torque on the drive gear to lift the weight.

#### Notes
Evaluation:

Handles load perfectly fine
Well balanced because of the wide base
Gears are well secured onto shafts

Gears aren't very smooth when lifting load
Handle feels weak because of having low torque because of small distance to the center of the gear
Rope slips with heavier loads (could not thread rope onto gear)

Starts struggling with applied load at around 300g
Could not handle loads of 500g
