# Final Evaluation and Test

For the final test and evaluation of the mechanism, we applied increasing loads until the mechanism couldn't handle any more force.

First, we applied the target load of 30g. Which the mechanism handled perfectly, with no stress on the gears other than a slight added extra resistance.

Second, we applied a weight of 150g. Which again, the mechanism handles fine. The additional load increased the resistance between the gears, but it wasn't enough to affect the performance of the mechanism significantly.

Third, a weight of 300g was applied. The mechanism could handle this, but we decided this was rough limit of the mechanism's ability.

Finally, we applied a weight of 500g, which the mechanism could not handle. It seemed as if the handle would break, and there was not enough torque on the drive gear to lift the weight.

#### Notes

Handles load perfectly fine
Well balanced because of the wide base
Gears are well secured onto shafts

Gears aren't very smooth when lifting load
Handle feels weak because of having low torque because of small distance to the center of the gear
Rope slips with heavier loads (could not thread rope onto gear)

Starts struggling with applied load at around 300g
Could not handle loads of 500g

## Improvements 

There a few possible improvements that could be made to a second iteration of the mechanism.

### Longer handle on input gear
- A longer handle on the input gear would increase the input torque, meaning in a higher weight limit.

### Non-helical gears
- Non-helical gears could be tested to see if the resistance between the gears is less overall. This would make it easier to lift loads.

### Alternative way of threading rope
- As the rope could not be threaded onto the driven gear properly, an alternative design could be considered.
