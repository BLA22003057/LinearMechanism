# Considerations When Making the Final Design

For the final design, there were a few features that we chose to improve the overall performance of the mechanism.

#### Minimal Frame
To reduce the size and weight of the design, I designed the frame with the shafts to mount the gears at the bottom. This means that there is less material required towards the top of the mechanism, which reduces weight and increases stability.

#### Double Helical Gears
When designing the gears, I realised that it was very likely for them to slip off where they were attached, and wouldn't have constant contact with eachother, leading to the possibility of dysfunction and inaccuracy. 

#### Modular
The full design has many components, so that it is easier to redesign a part without having to manufacture more than just a single component.
