# Design Considerations When Making the final design

We decided to place the gears at the bottom of out design so the mechanism would be bottom heavy and therefore more stable, this is becasuse of we had kept them at the stop, while pulling the load the mechanism may fall over or start to wobble. As a result of this, we added a pully system to make sure the load travels the necessary distnace.

We made the base that the gears connect to very simple to use less material and reduce the time it takes to print the parts, we had done this because havig a solid block as the base plate would not have been necessary and 'overkill' for the specs of the mechanism.

We added propper feet to the base to help with stability as we didnt believe that the base would be able to hold itself up. As a result, we designed them to be easy to attach to the base as they just slip on at the bottom, this is better then having the feet attached to the base because it would be more complitcated to print and waste more material as it would need to use stands to hold the base in place as it prints.

We added a lever system to the driver gear so when we opperate the system, we do not need to touch the gears with out hands which reduces the saftey risks of trapping your hands in-between the gears. Also it gives us a greater overall mechanical advantage rather then just the MA between the two gears.
