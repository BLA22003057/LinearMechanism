# Design Choices

## Design Candidates

For the project, we came up with three main designs.

1. **Pulley**
  The most simple design that we came up with. A pair of gears, the drive gear with a handle on it, and the driven gear with a spool for some string on it.
  The basic concept for this design was to attach the weight to the end of the string, and use the gears to pull the string onto the spool using mechanical advantage, eventually pulling the weight a height of 150mm.

2. **Leadscrew**
  A leadscrew mechanism, typically found in the Z-Axis of 3D printers, is a very accurate and strong mechanism used to move something linearly slowly with a lot of force. The mechanism features a long screw, and a form of chassis that screws onto the leadscrew. When the leadscrew turns, the chassis will move up or down depending on the direction that the leadscrew rotates.

3. **Lever**
   A mechanism that utilizes two gears with a high gear ratio to move a lever attached to the larger gear upwards. The lever would have a string attached to it that threads through a stand to keep the weight attached to the end in the same position and only move linearly.

## Final Choice

For the final design that we would develop and produce, we chose the pulley mechanism. Our reasons for why we chose this mechanism was:

###### Simplicity
The pulley mechanism is the simplest out of the three we chose, which leaves less chance for error in design and manufacture. A simpler design also was more suitable for our first project of the year.

###### Tried and True
This type of mechanism is very common for pulling weights over vertical distance. Similar mechanisms are used in cranes, wells, hoses, extension cables, and lots more.

###### Mechanical Advantage
A mechanism with gears can always have its mechanical advantage changed to be able to lift more or less weight, with a faster or slower speed. This makes the mechanism we are developing very adaptable to different loads.

## Which gear type is best for this application?

There are many different types of gears, each with their own individual purpose. 

###### Rack and pinion or spur gears?

For the final design, we decided that a pair of spur gears would be easiest to produce, and also easiest to design a frame to hold the gears on. A rack and pinion would also be larger overall in size, which would increase production time.

###### What type of spur gear?

There are a few types of spur gears that were worth considering: Parallel axis, Helical, Internal + External, and Bevel.

Each gear has varying complexity, strength, and resistance. As we are 3D printing the gears, we
