# **Project Specification: 30g Weight Lifting Mechanism**

### 1. **Project Overview**
- **Title**: Design and Manufacture of a 30g Weight Lifting Mechanism
- **Summary**: The goal of this project is to design and manufacture a mechanism capable of lifting a 30g weight by 150mm. The project is limited to 3 weeks, and we are encouraged to 3D print all components.
- **Stakeholders**:  
  - Thea Blake, Jacob Broomfield – Design and Manufacturing
  - Various Tutors – Project Supervisors

### 2. **Objectives**
- Design a mechanism that lifts a 30g weight by 150mm.
- Preferably manufacture all components using 3D printing.
- Complete the project within 3 weeks.
- Ensure the mechanism operates reliably and efficiently.

### 3. **Scope**
- **In Scope**:
  - Design of a mechanical system.
  - 3D printing of all parts.
  - Testing and validation of the mechanism.
- **Out of Scope**:
  - Complex control systems or external power supplies beyond basic mechanical operation.

### 4. **Requirements**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - Mechanism must lift a 30g weight by at least 150mm.
  - Must be powered manually or with a basic motor/actuator.
  - Entire design must be 3D printable.
- **Non-Functional Requirements**:
  - The mechanism should be lightweight and durable.
  - Should operate smoothly without requiring excessive force.
  - Aesthetic considerations (if applicable).
  - The mechanism should be simple and fast to manufacture and assemble.

### 5. **Specifications and Design**
- **Technical Details**:
  - 30g weight capacity.
  - 150mm lift height.
  - All components will be designed using CAD software (e.g., Fusion 360, OnShape).
  - Materials: PLA for 3D printed parts, String for suspending the weight.
- **System Design**:
  - A pulley system, rack and pinion, or lever-based mechanism will be considered.
  - Diagrams will be developed after brainstorming concepts.

### 6. **Resources and Budget**
- **Resources**:
  - Access to a 3D printer.
  - Basic tools for post-processing (cutting, sanding, etc.).
  - CAD software for design.
- **Budget**: Estimated to be within £10-20 for materials (e.g., filament for 3D printing).

### 7. **Timeline and Milestones**
- **Week 1**: Concept development, CAD design.
- **Week 2**: 3D printing of components, initial assembly.
- **Week 3**: Testing, adjustments, and final assembly.
- **Milestones**:
  - Conceptual design complete by the end of Week 1.
  - 3D printing completed by mid-Week 2.
  - Mechanism tested and finalized by the end of Week 3.

### 8. **Risks and Challenges**
- **Risk 1**: Mechanical failure of 3D printed parts.  
  *Mitigation*: Print test parts early to verify strength and durability.
- **Risk 2**: Time constraints with the 3D printer.  
  *Mitigation*: Plan 3D print schedules efficiently, leaving room for reprints if needed.
- **Risk 3**: Design complexity leading to print or assembly issues.  
  *Mitigation*: Keep the design as simple as possible while meeting requirements.

### 9. **Testing and Validation**
- Test the mechanism by attaching a 30g weight and measuring lift height.
- Performance will be evaluated based on whether the mechanism lifts the weight by 150mm without failure.
- Benchmarks: Successful lift in under 5 seconds (or other criteria if relevant).
- **Further testing**
- Test the mechanism with additional weight, possibly until failure.

### 10. **Deliverables**
- CAD design files.
- Fully assembled 3D printed mechanism.
- Report on the design and manufacturing process.
- Video demonstration of the mechanism lifting the 30g weight.

### 11. **Maintenance and Support**
- No significant maintenance expected; components should be durable under normal conditions.
- Any necessary repairs or reprints will be handled post-project (if applicable).

### 12. **Appendices**
- CAD diagrams, 3D model files, and any additional documentation related to the design process.
